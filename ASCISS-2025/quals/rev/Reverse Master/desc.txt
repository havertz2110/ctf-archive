Reverse Master - 100 - 90 solves
🔐 The Reverse Master Challenge 🔐

A mysterious organization has developed a mobile authentication system that claims to be ""reverse-proof"". Your task is to prove them wrong.

The application validates a secret passphrase, but the validation logic is protected by multiple layers of obfuscation:

Multi-layer Java/Kotlin code obfuscation
Native JNI implementation with encryption
Anti-debugging mechanisms
Anti-tamper protection
Dynamic key generation
Your objectives:

Bypass security checks
Reverse the validation algorithm
Extract the correct passphrase
Tools you might need:

APK decompiler (jadx, apktool)
ARM disassembler (Ghidra, IDA, radare2)
Dynamic analysis tools (optional: Frida,)
